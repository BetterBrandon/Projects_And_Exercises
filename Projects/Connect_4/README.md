# Connect Four

## Purpose

During my Website Design course in college, one of the projects was to recreate the game, Connect Four and have the board appear dynamically by using the **DOM**. At the time, I found it rather challenging to create the logic for the game and how to check for a winner.

I thought this would be a fun project to retest myself and see how I could do with it. So here is the product of that. Enjoy and have fun!
