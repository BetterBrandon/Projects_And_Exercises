# Recipe Finder Website

## Version 1

The main intent of this project was to get more familarity with how **Bootstrap** works and to practice using **Axios** for HTTP requests. I used Bootstrap for all of the styling on the site, and to make sure that it is responsive for the viewport size. Learning how to implement the Navbar, carousel, 3 cards, and adding some fake text and a quote to make the site a little more formidable. Each card generates a random meal to showcase. A meal decription is generated as well.

In addition, I am also practicing on how to use Axios for retrieving data, then use the **JSON** information to be displayed for the site. [The Meal DB](https://www.themealdb.com/) was the API that was used in this project. I thought I might be able to achieve everything I had in mind for the site by adding some more pages, to display a recipe for instance. But, there will be more tools needed To make the site more dyanmic. The Bootstrap and Axios scripts are on the `index.html` page.

### Installation

1. Downlad the repoistory
2. Run the `V1/index.html` file where you have saved it

## Version 2

I will be implementing **Express** for version 2 and use **EJS**, which is a templating language.
I had to do some critical thinking working on the next version of this project. How I implemented version 1 was using client side JS to achieve the Axios calls, then change the home page elements navigating the **DOM**. With my limited experience with Express and Axios at the time, I thought that would be a do-able solution. Well, it got more confusing with more logic and routes that got added. I was getting errors trying to utilize those client side Axios calls with different Express routes. Maybe it could of been done, but I decided to backtrack on what I got working correctly on the backend.

With some practice of some exercises. I quickly realized that doing most of the heavy lifting on the back-end is not only smarter, but preffered. With this new found strategy in place. I was able to add the (type what routes I added) into place.
